# AWS-Sage-Maker-Workshop

These are some sage maker hands-on Lab I successfully completed in the workshop
* [sagemaker] (https://sagemaker-workshop.com/) â€“ AWS sagemaker
## The workshop &copy; 2018

* Doing the labs in 2020 is Great, **Note** that some UI have changed.
* I **highly recommend** it for Junior to Mid-level developers new to machine learning on **AWS**.

* If you want to do the Lab, click the link above and follow the instructions.
* If you are new to AWS and you are using the AWS Free-Tier Account, you will face service limit issues.... No need to worry much, just contact support and they will assist you to resolve the issues.
